## Usage

Install and see it work!

## Details

The extension monitors for backspaces and erases the current line if it is concluded that the line is empty or filled with whitespace.

There is a special edge-case issue with backspaces introduced by the `trimTrailingWhitespace` editor option. If it causes a problem for you, adjust the settings of the extension. (`smartBackspace.delay`)
